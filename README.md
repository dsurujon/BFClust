# BFClust

Boundary Forest Clustering is a pan-genome clustering pipeline written in MATLAB. An example use case is provided in the script ```cluster_example.m```. This example takes the  ```T4first10.fasta``` sequence set as input (there are 50 sequences; 5 identical copies of 10 genes, so this should yield 10 clusters). The example output of BFClust can be found in ```testout```.
