# BFClust

Boundary Forest Clustering is a pan-genome clustering pipeline written in MATLAB. An example use case is provided in the script ```cluster_example.m```. This example takes the  ```dataset-010-0.fasta``` sequence set as input (there are 500 sequences; 50 copies of 10 genes with a small mutation rate, so this should yield 10 clusters). The example output of BFClust can be found in ```testout```.
